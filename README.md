### Installation

#### Baremetal

1. Download or clone this repo and move the files into your web root - usually `/var/www/html`
2. Rename `/db/wallos.empty.db` to `/db/wallos.db`
3. Run `http://domain.example/endpoints/db/migrate.php` on your browser
4. Add the following scripts to your cronjobs with `crontab -e`

```bash
0 1 * * * php /var/www/html/endpoints/cronjobs/updatenextpayment.php >> /var/log/cron/updatenextpayment.log 2>&1
0 2 * * * php /var/www/html/endpoints/cronjobs/updateexchange.php >> /var/log/cron/updateexchange.log 2>&1
0 9 * * * php /var/www/html/endpoints/cronjobs/sendnotifications.php >> /var/log/cron/sendnotifications.log 2>&1
```

5. If your web root is not `/var/www/html/` adjust both the cronjobs above and `/endpoints/cronjobs/conf.php` accordingly.

#### Updating

1. Re-download the repo and move the files into the correct folder or do `git pull` (if you used git clone before)
2. Check the [Prerequisites](#baremetal) and install / enable the missing ones, if any.
3. Run `http://domain.example/endpoints/db/migrate.php`

#### Docker

```bash
docker run -d --name wallos -v /path/to/config/wallos/db:/var/www/html/db \
-v /path/to/config/wallos/logos:/var/www/html/images/uploads/logos \
-e TZ=Europe/Berlin -p 8282:80 --restart unless-stopped \
bellamy/wallos:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```
version: '3.0'

services:
  wallos:
    container_name: wallos
    image: bellamy/wallos:latest
    ports:
      - "8282:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Toronto'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './db:/var/www/html/db'
      - './logos:/var/www/html/images/uploads/logos'
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Usage

Just open the browser and open `ip:port` of the machine running wallos.  
On the first time you run wallos a user account must be created.  
Go to settings and personalise your Avatar and add members of your household. While there add / remove any categories and currencies.  
Get a free API Key from [Fixer](https://fixer.io/#pricing_plan) and add it in the settings.  
If you want to trigger an Update of the exchange rates, change your main currency after adding the API Key, and then change it back to your prefered one.
